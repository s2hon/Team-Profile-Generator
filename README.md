### Version 
1.0.0

### Features
My goal was to build a software engineering team generator command line application.
Application needed to prompt the following:
1. information about the team manager 
2. information about the team engineer
3. information about the team intern
* user can input any number of team members
* they may be a mix of engineers and interns

My core goals of this project was to build constructors to build classes when the user enters the respective information about employees.
I also needed to collect and write functions to generate the final HTML website. Addtionally I used validation to ensure that the information provided is in the proper expected format and went back to optimized my code.
